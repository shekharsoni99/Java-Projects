Question 1: What is normalization and why it is needed?

Ans: Normalization is a process of organizing the data in database to avoid data redundancy (duplication), insertion anomaly, update anomaly & deletion anomaly. 
The purpose of normalization is to maximize the efficiency of a database.

Question 2: Explain the 3NF with an example.

Ans: 
Table must be in 2NF
Transitive functional dependency of non-prime attribute on any super key should be
removed.

Book	          	Author			Author_age
Game of Thrones		George R. R. Martin	66
Harry Potter		J. K. Rowling		49
Dying of the Light	George R. R. Martin	66

{Book} ->{Author} (if we know the book, we knows the author name)

{Author} does not ->{Book}

{Author} -> {Author_age}

Therefore as per the rule of transitive dependency: {Book} -> {Author_age} should hold, that makes sense because if we know the book name we can know the authorâ€™s age.


Make two seperate tables:
 1. Book and author
 2. Author and Author_age
 
 to remove transitive dependency
